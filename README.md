🧠 Today's Focus:
I built a Content-Based Movie Recommendation System that suggests movies similar to a given one—based on storyline, cast, director, and genre.

At first, I was genuinely confused about how to make accurate predictions. Then cosine similarity clicked in my mind!
I merged multiple text features and converted them into vectors using the Bag of Words technique. That opened the door to meaningful comparisons between movies.

🎬 Best Part of the Model:
Some movies may share the same name but have entirely different plots—which can ruin the user's experience.
Instead of relying on names or popularity, this model focuses on story, cast, and genre, ensuring that the top 5 recommended movies truly match the content the user enjoys.

📌 How It Works:
✅ Combines metadata (plot, actors, director, genres) into one string
✅ Vectorizes using Bag of Words
✅ Applies cosine similarity to find the top 5 most similar movies

📈 Tech Stack:
Python | Pandas | Scikit-learn | Streamlit

🌐 Use Case Impact:
A must-have feature for any streaming platform or movie discovery tool—this system offers smarter, content-aware recommendations instead of generic suggestions.
